# Texting-and-Driving-Reduction-App
FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT REQUEST.

I was sitting in the Taco Bell drive thru last night and there was a story about texting and driving on the radio. 
It gave me an idea that I think is great. Since its my idea, though, I need another opinion. 
Plus, I am a student of human behavior and so I haven't gottend around to checking coding off my to do list. 
Unfortunatly, I have no idea what it would take to build or maintain the app I describe.  

If I had a better idea of the amount of time and skill that would be involved, I could get a better idea of how much funding I'd need.
I also want to know what the most serious design challenges will be with the project. I'm worried about battery drain already. 

I'm a broke 25 year old in my last year of a graduate program at a wealthy university. I want to leverage that before my time is up.
If you are willing to help me determine the project's feasibility or are interested in helping in another way, please do. 
I can't do this alone and if the project is feasible, it could save lives. 

Perspective: 

An app that helps me train me to do what I know is right

This mobile device application is for people who agree that texting and driving is dangerous to themselves and others. Who also text and drive more often than they would like to. But, have found the habit to be more stubborn than their current strategies are helpful. This app is an aid for breaking the habit of texting and driving. 

Most of us understand that using our phones while driving can have horrendous, life shattering consequences. We also know that those consequences are relatively unlikely in any given instance. That’s probably why we give the decision of whether to check a notification with about as much thought as we give to deciding whether to get ‘clean and fresh’ or ‘refreshing blast’ scented deodorant. We segment the risk to rationalize ignoring what we know to be a problematic pattern. 

Our truth is that a lot of us have a dangerous, selfish habit, and most of us know it. Yet, we don’t really know what to do about it. Habits are the behaviors we have learned well enough to do effortlessly and mindlessly. Extinguishing a habit takes about the same amount of effort and thought as was not applied for about as long as it wasn’t. The app provides a self-intervention for a risky behavior, and an organic learning opportunity for skills and techniques that can be applied later without the app’s assistance. 

How It Works

After installation, a user is prompted to create an account and complete a short survey. It asks things like; if they bike, who they love, who depends on them, etc. In general we would collect the useful bits of info needed to create a profile that includes their risky behavior patterns, why the user wants to break their habit and what things the user cares about enough to use as motivation. Users are given the option of uploading pictures of loved ones who would be impacted if the user was to be seriously injured or died. This step allows “perspective triggers” to be tailored to individual users.

The application runs in the background when the screen is on and an accelerometer activates it. The accelerometer also regulates the user experience. 

When the accelerometer reaches 2-3 miles per hour the layer one perspective triggers will be displayed when the screen lights up or is unlocked. 

Layer one perspective triggers appear when the device is travelling between 2-10 mph.

A vine style video of someone walking/running in front of a car or knocking over and injuring a vulnerable and sympathetic innocent. 

Meme style pictures of gruesome injuries caused by texting and walking with short quotes about how funny physical therapy really was or how long it took to get another job may also be effective.

Layer two perspective triggers appear when the device is travelling between 10-20 mph.

Similarly graphic vines and memes associated with drivers in circumstances where drivers feel safe texting because they are going slow then hit a vulnerable and sympathetic innocent or cause a chain of events with tragic repercussions. 

Layer three perspective triggers appear when the device is travelling above 20 mph. You get the theme. This level may also include grief stricken parents, children or other loved ones based on their profile with text describing their relation to the person killed by a texting and driving related accident. User uploaded photos could be overlaid with ‘Is it worth their risk?’. 

All layered trigger perspectives would be set to a variable ratio schedule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Reinforcement). Because apparently, mystery moves memories to myelinate.

When a user is at a stop light and the accelerometer comes to zero, a timer or an hourglass starts running in the corner each time the phone screen is activated so that people can remember to be conscious of how long it has been since they looked up. 

The user is both conditioned to think perspective when in a risky phone use situation, and is presented with opportunities to learn the techniques used by the app from memory to gain control of other habitual behaviors. 

Public Health Business Plan

Many people can build an app that does what was just described with little effort or expense, and many people can promote the app so that it reaches a wide audience. I’m not the best person to do either. I am a person who can find some people who can, and convince them to. So, I’ll do that. As long as no one in particular has to give a lot, self pride and heartfelt recognition will be exchanged for services rendered. There will be the fixed cost of updating the app and dealing with bugs. 

The app’s page in the app stores could give users the option to either download a donated license for the app for free. Or alternatively, make a small “donation” in exchange for a license to use the app on their own device in addition to another license that is added to the stock of donated licenses available. A different version could be given to those  who donate which identifies them as a donator by putting “thank you for your donation” on the app’s icon. Functionally, it is a reinforcing mechanism because users are more likely to show others the app on their phone if their donative status is made clear. People are also more likely to donate in the first place. To prevent resentment, people could be given the option to take a donated version for a “test drive” for a few days with the expectation being set that the user will be asked whether they would like to make a donation, keep their donated version, or “throw it back” into the stock for someone else.
